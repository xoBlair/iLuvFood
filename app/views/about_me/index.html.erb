Foodies are people who love eating and sharing cool new food ideas. Scarf is a simple way to search for, create, and post links to recipes with other foodies. Whether you are linking to a recipe from a popular blog or posting your own recipes and pictures, Scarf makes it easy to share your favorite food ideas. 


For individuals not as familiar with the web/uploading images and links, we’ve implemented an option to enter a text-only recipe. It’s easy enough for Grandma to create an account and her classic cookie recipe using a form input with text only.
